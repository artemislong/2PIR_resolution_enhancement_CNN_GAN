### üìÑ 250-Word Abstract:
Non-invasive, label-free microscopy systems have seen significant improvements in imaging quality for tissue analysis and diagnostics. High lateral imaging resolution in novel ex vivo imaging systems has enabled the development of algorithms to extract functional information from living tissues. However, in vivo clinical microscopic imaging systems may have limited imaging resolution to extract relevant functional information. Modifying clinical imaging hardware to increase resolution can be constrained by regulatory and engineering challenges. Therefore, low-resolution (LR) images require computational methods to recover important signals. 

Deep autoencoding neural networks have demonstrated substantial signal restoration and resolution enhancement in microscopic imaging. This study aims to restore functional metrics from LR images of human cervical tissue using supervised and unsupervised deep autoencoding algorithms. A total of 724 images of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) and flavoproteins were acquired ex vivo using two-photon excited fluorescence within freshly excised stratified squamous epithelial tissues. A supervised deep convolutional autoencoder and a reversible unsupervised deep learning algorithm were trained using overlapping patches of LR images as inputs and paired high-resolution (HR) image patches as ground truths.

Optical redox ratio and mitochondrial clustering in restored images are evaluated to assess the impact of algorithms on functional metrics extraction. The reversed unsupervised algorithm reduces the resolution of HR images to quantitatively assess the impact of LR imaging on metabolic information acquisition. Improved functional metrics extraction in the clinical environment is expected to accelerate the clinical translation of novel non-invasive diagnostic solutions.
